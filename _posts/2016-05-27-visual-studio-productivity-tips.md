### 1 - Keep Track of your active files inside Solution Explorer Automatically

- Navigate To Tools -> Options -> Projects and Solutions -> General -> **”Track Active Item in Solution Explorer”**

### 2 - Run To Cursor

-  As a colleague [GT] showed me abuse of debugger is not healthy. But sometimes could be useful, for this cases you could use "Run To Cursor" `Ctrl + F10` instead put breackpoint every time you want to stop in a line.
