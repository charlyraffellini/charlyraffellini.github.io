### 1 - Keep Track of your active files inside Solution Explorer Automatically

- Navigate To Tools -> Options -> Projects and Solutions -> General -> **”Track Active Item in Solution Explorer”**

### 2 - Run To Cursor

-  As a colleague [GT] showed me abuse of debugger is not healthy. But sometimes could be useful, for this cases you could use "Run To Cursor" `Ctrl + F10` instead put breackpoint every time you want to stop in a line.

### 3 - Place "Reusable Code" into the Toolbox

- This seems like Copy-Paste-Pattern. Yes, but could be useful to use not business code, or templates among differents solutions. For instance: Test Classes Templates, sometimes is a waste of time put the same structure for each new test file.

### 4 - Find Clone Codes in Solution

- How haven't I realize of this tool before? Just select a piece of code > Right Click > "Find Clone Codes in Solution", and voilà. You 'll see possible code clones grouped by "Clonality Weight".

### 5 - Create your own Layouts

- You can just save your layouts and invoque one when you want.
