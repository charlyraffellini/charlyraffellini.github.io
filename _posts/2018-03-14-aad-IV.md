# Azure Active Directory Part IV - Group Claims

I recently discovered we can retrieve which groups an user is a member of when the user authenticates to our application.

This has been there for long but I will explain anyway.

## Pre-conditions

- The same requisites to retrieve an id_token through OpenID flow.
- In the application manifest to set the field `groupMembershipClaims` to "All" or "SecurityGroup".

## Get the `id_token` with OpenID Connect flow

- As in previous posts.

## Post-conditions

- The `id_token` contains a new field call `groups` which contains the `object id` of the different groups the user is a member.

```json
  ...
  "groups": [
    "19d18b95-b12c-4982-8394-3ae9aa2edd86",
    "fd9d8cba-47bf-47b7-bdf8-4e2ff4672cfe"
  ],
  ...
```
