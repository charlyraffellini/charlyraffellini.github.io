title: Creating my blog

Finally I create my blog using GitHub Pages. To do that I followed these sites:

- [Using Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/) in GitHub Help.
- [Jekyll documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/).
- I found a _Jekyll blog seed_ [here](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/), which I forked to start this blog.
