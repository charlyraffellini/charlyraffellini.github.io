# Access the Microsoft Graph API

Using the Graph API you can get programmatic access to different resources in AAD and other Microsoft resources. For instance, list users in your directory, groups, group members, applications, etc.

I will run an example of it getting an `access_token` and using it to query the Graph API.

# Pre-conditions
- Having an app with Application Permissions to call the Graph API.
- Having an App Id and App Key.

# Getting an `access_token`

We follow the `client_credentials` flow to get an `access_token` based on the application permissions of the app. In this case, we are not interested in the delegated permissions of the application, however, it is possible to do it using delegated permissions.

```http
POST /{tenant_id}/oauth2/v2.0/token HTTP/1.1
Host: login.microsoftonline.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=client_credentials&client_id={app_id}&client_secret={app_secret_key}&scope=https%3A%2F%2Fgraph.microsoft.com%2F.default
```

This will return a json containing the `access_token` that represents our application talking to the Microsoft Graph API.

In essence, we will get an `access_token` with the following information:

```json
{
  "aud": "https://graph.microsoft.com",
  ...
  "app_displayname": "GraphAPIApp",
  ...
  "roles": [
    "EduRoster.Read.All",
    "Mail.ReadWrite",
    "Device.ReadWrite.All",
    "User.ReadWrite.All",
    "Domain.ReadWrite.All",
    "SecurityEvents.Read.All",
    "Calendars.Read",
    "EduAssignments.ReadWrite.All",
    "People.Read.All",
    "Group.Read.All",
    "Directory.ReadWrite.All",
    "EduAssignments.ReadWriteBasic.All",
    "MailboxSettings.Read",
    "EduAdministration.Read.All",
    "Sites.Read.All",
    "Sites.ReadWrite.All",
    "Contacts.ReadWrite",
    "Group.ReadWrite.All",
    "Sites.Manage.All",
    "SecurityEvents.ReadWrite.All",
    "Notes.Read.All",
    "User.Invite.All",
    "EduRoster.ReadWrite.All",
    "Files.ReadWrite.All",
    "Directory.Read.All",
    "User.Read.All",
    "EduAssignments.ReadBasic.All",
    "EduRoster.ReadBasic.All",
    "Files.Read.All",
    "Mail.Read",
    "EduAssignments.Read.All",
    "Calendars.ReadWrite",
    "EduAdministration.ReadWrite.All",
    "Mail.Send",
    "MailboxSettings.ReadWrite",
    "Contacts.Read",
    "IdentityRiskEvent.Read.All",
    "AuditLog.Read.All",
    "Member.Read.Hidden",
    "Sites.FullControl.All",
    "Reports.Read.All",
    "Notes.ReadWrite.All"
  ],
  ...
  "ver": "1.0"
}
```

## Post-conditions - Using the `access_token` to query the Microsoft Graph API:

For instance, let's get the members of a group:

```http
GET /beta/groups/{group_id}/members
HTTP/1.1
Host: graph.microsoft.com
Authorization: Bearer {access_token}
```
We will receive a list of `users` that are members of the group.
