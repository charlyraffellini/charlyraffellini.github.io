## Stored Access Policies

They are a way to control access to resources in Shared Access Signatures.

Stored Access Policies apply only to:

- Blob Container
- File Share
- Table
- Queue

They have:

- Id (the name we chose)
- Start
- Expire
- Permissions (read, write, delete, list)

The maximum number of Stored Access Policies per Blob Container, File Share, Table or Queue is **5**.

## Stored Access Policy in Shared Access Signature

Stored Access Policies apply only for [Service Level SAS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/constructing-a-service-sas). It Stored Access Policies doesn't apply to [Account Level SAS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/constructing-an-account-sas).

Service Level SAS can apply to a Blob Container, specific Blob, File Share or File.

Here is an example:

`https://charlietest.blob.core.windows.net/principal?sv=2017-04-17&sr=c&si=example-policy&sig=mh2xWBoJGcsLHQPY8COt7%2BbGftQenscPlIkYsVpqZLA%3D`

It shows the following:

- `sr`: this is the resource we are targeting. In this case is `c` for a container. `b` for a blob is also supported in case we want to aim for a blob.

- `si` is the policy we have stored in the container.

- `sv`: signed storage service version to use to authenticate requests made with this account SAS.

- `sig` signature. It was encrypted using the primary key.

## Using the Shared Access Signature for listing blobs

Now let's use this signature to [list all blobs under the container](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/list-blobs); assuming you already have that permissions in the Stored Access Policy. If the Stored Access Policy doesn't have list permission it can be added without modifying the signature.

`GET https://charlietest.blob.core.windows.net/principal?sv=2017-04-17&sr=c&si=example-policy&sig=mh2xWBoJGcsLHQPY8COt7%2BbGftQenscPlIkYsVpqZLA%3D&restype=container&comp=list`

Have a look I added `&restype=container&comp=list` to the original URL. This does not affect the signature.

The response is something similar to:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<EnumerationResults ServiceEndpoint="https://charlietest.blob.core.windows.net/" ContainerName="principal">
    <Blobs>
        <Blob>
            <Name>samplefile.log</Name>
            <Properties>
                <Last-Modified>Wed, 28 Mar 2018 20:41:12 GMT</Last-Modified>
                <Etag>0x8D594EC3E9330CF</Etag>
                <Content-Length>16</Content-Length>
                <Content-Type>application/octet-stream</Content-Type>
                <Content-Encoding />
                <Content-Language />
                <Content-MD5>CfnNAq/Wy7+Mb2WVvMTihw==</Content-MD5>
                <Cache-Control />
                <Content-Disposition />
                <BlobType>BlockBlob</BlobType>
                <LeaseStatus>unlocked</LeaseStatus>
                <LeaseState>available</LeaseState>
                <ServerEncrypted>true</ServerEncrypted>
            </Properties>
        </Blob>
    </Blobs>
    <NextMarker />
</EnumerationResults>
```

## Conclusion

Shared Access Policies can be used to control access to containers without client intervention. For instance, you can give full access to a user and remove that access in case the security of the data is compromised or malicious use of the container is detected. You can still give limited access to other users of the blobs inside a container using a SAS with a sensible expiration time.
