### The verbs/expressions dare, ought to, had better, and need not behave like modal auxiliaries to a large extent, although they are not productive in the role to the same extent as those listed here.

### Defectiveness


Modals in English form a very distinctive class of verbs. They are auxiliary verbs like be, do, and have, but they are defective insofar as they cannot be inflected like these other auxiliary verbs, e.g. have → has vs. should → \*shoulds, do → did vs. may → \*mayed, etc. In clauses that contain two or more verbs, any modal that is present appears as the left-most verb in the verb catena (= chain of verbs). What this means is that the modal verb is always finite (although it is, as stated, never inflected). In the syntactic structure of the clause, the modal verb is the clause root. The following dependency grammar trees illustrate the point:

The verb catenae are in blue. The modal auxiliary in both trees is the root of the entire sentence. The verb that is immediately subordinate to the modal is always an infinitive. The fact that modal auxiliaries in English are necessarily finite means that within the minimal finite clause that contains them, they can never be subordinate to another verb, e.g.


- Sam may have done his homework. - *The modal auxiliary may is the root of the clause.*
- \*Sam has may done his homework. - *The sentence fails because the modal auxiliary may is not the root of the clause.*


- Jim will be helped. - The modal auxiliary will is the root of the clause.
- \*Jim is will be helped. - The sentence fails because the modal auxiliary will is not the root of the clause.


This trait of modal auxiliaries has motivated the designation defective, that is, modal auxiliaries are defective in English because they are so limited in their form and distribution. One can note further in this area that English modal auxiliaries are quite unlike modal verbs in closely related languages.

**\*** Modality: The modal approach to modality, an utterance expressing modality can always roughly be paraphrased to fit the following template:


**According to [a set of rules, wishes, beliefs,...] \(1) it is [necessary, possible] \(2) that [the main proposition] is the case.**


The set of propositions which forms the basis of evaluation is called the *modal base (1)*. The result of the evaluation is called the *modal force (2)*.


I.E., John must be earning a lot of money - The modal base here is the knowledge of the speaker, the modal force is necessity. The utterance expresses that, according to what the speaker has observed, it is necessary to conclude that John has a rather high income.


I.E., John can open a beer bottle with his teeth. It could be paraphrased as ‘Given his abilities, the strength of his teeth, etc., it is possible for John to open a beer bottle with his teeth’. Here, the modal base is defined by a subset of John's abilities, the modal force is possibility.


### Types of modality

- **Epistemic modality,** concerned with the **theoretical possibility** of propositions being true or not true (including *likelihood and certainty*).
  - You **must** be starving. ("It is necessarily the case that you are starving.")
- **Deontic modality,** concerned with possibility and **necessity** in terms of freedom to act (including permission and duty).
  - You **must** leave now. ("You are required to leave now.")
- **Dynamic modality,** which may be distinguished from deontic modality, in that with dynamic modality, the **conditioning factors are internal** – the subject's own ability or willingness to act.
