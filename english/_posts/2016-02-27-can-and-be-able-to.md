![can or be able to]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/can_could_be_able.jpg)



Both **can** and **be able to** can be used to talk about ability. In some cases they are interchangeable.


We were talking about **general ability**. Things that we **can** or we **could do** at any time in the present or in the past.

## **Using can to talk about our present ability**

* **Can** is used in the present tense. It is used to talk about our ability to do things.

  *   I can swim.
  *   She can speak English well.
  *   I can swim across that stream.

* **Be able to** is also possible in these cases; however, it sounds a bit more formal here. In spoken English, we are less likely to use **was able to.**

  *   I am able to knit. (Less natural than ‘I can knit.’)
  *   She is able to speak English well.


## To talk about our past ability, we use **could**. **Was/were able to** is also possible.

Study the examples given below.

  *   She **could** read when she was three. **OR** She **was able to read** when she was three.

## To talk about things that we managed to do on specific occasions in the past or we will manage in the future

* We cannot use **could**. Instead, we use **was/were able to.** The verb **managed, succeeded (in…ing)** are also possible in this case.

  *   I **was able to** get some really good bargains in the sale. **(NOT I could get some really good bargains in the sale.)**

  *   After climbing for several hours, we **managed** to get to the top of the mountain. OR After climbing for several hours, we **were able to get** to the top of the mountain. **(NOT … we could get to the top of the mountain.)**


## To talk about things that we were not capable of manage on specific occasions

* Both **could** and **be able to** can be used to say that we were not capable of doing something on a specific occasion.

  *   In spite of climbing for hours, we **couldn’t get** to the top of the mountain. **OR** In spite of climbing for hours, we **weren’t able to** get to the top of the mountain.
