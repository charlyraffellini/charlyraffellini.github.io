We use **_will_**:

  *   to talk about the future – to say what we believe will happen
  *   to talk about what people want to do or are willing to do
  *   to make promises and offers

_**would** _is the **past** tense form of _will_. Because it is a past tense it is used:

  *   to talk about the past.
  *   to talk about hypotheses – things that are imagined rather than true.
  *   for politeness.

#### Beliefs

We use _**will**_ to say what we believe will happen in the future: _(futuro simple)_:

  * We**'ll be** late.  
  * We **will have to** take the train.

We use **_would_ **as the past tense of _will_:

* to say what we believed would happen _(condicional o condicional compuesto)_:

  * I thought I **would be** late …… so I **would have to** take the train.

#### Offers and promises

We use **_I will_** or **_We will_ **to make offers and promises _(futuro)_:

  * **I’ll give** you a lift home after the party.  
  * **We will** come and see you next week.

#### Willingness

* to talk about what people want to do or are willing to do:

  * We**’ll see** you tomorrow.  
  * Perhaps dad **will lend** me the car.

We use **_would_ **as the past tense of _will_:

* to talk about what people wanted to do or were willing to do:

  * We had a terrible night. The baby **wouldn’t go** to sleep. He kept waking up and crying.  
  * Dad **wouldn’t lend** me the car, so we had to take the train.

*   to talk about something that we did often in the past because we wanted to do it _(preterito imperfecto)_:

  * When they were children they used to spend their holidays at their grandmother’s at the seaside. They **would get up** early every morning and they**’d have** a quick breakfast then they **would run** across the road to the beach.

#### Conditionals

We use **_will_ **in conditionals with **_if_** and **_unless_** to say what we think will happen in the future or present:

  * I**’ll give** her a call if I can find her number.  
  * You **won’t get in** unless you have a ticket.

We use **_would_ **to talk about hypotheses, about something which is possible but not real:

* to talk about the result or effect of a possible situation:

  * It **would be** very expensive to stay in a hotel.

* in conditionals with words like **_if_ **and **_what if_**. In these sentences the main verb is usually in the <u>past tense</u>:

  * I **would give** her a call if I <u>could</u> find her number.  
  * If I <u>had</u> the money I**'d buy** a new car.  
  * You **would lose** weight if you <u>took</u> more exercise.  
  * If he <u>got</u> a new job he **would probably make** more money.  
  * What if he <u>lost</u> his job. What **would happen** then?

We use conditionals to give **advice**:

  * Dan **will help** you if you ask him.

**Past** tenses are **more polite**:

Dan **would help** you if you **asked** him.

#### Phrases with would:

*   **_would you…_**, **_would you mind (not) -ing_**, for requests:

  * Would you carry this for me, please?  
  * Would you mind carrying this?  
  * Would you mind not telling him that?

*   **_would you like ..._**; _**would you like to ...**_,  for offers and invitations:

  * Would you like to come round tomorrow?  
  * Would you like another drink?

*   **_I would like …_**; **_I’d like … (you)(to) ..._**, to say what we want or what we want to do:

  * I’d like to go home now.

*   **_I’d rather…_** (I would rather) to say what we prefer:

  * I’d rather have that one.  
  * I’d rather go home now.

*   **_I would think_**, _**I would imagine**_, **_I'd guess_**, to give an opinion when we are not sure or when we want to be polite:
